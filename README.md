#### Output
```
Optional Letters - n c m u a b e a
Required Letters - l
With that letter set, there are 117 valid words

abel
abele
able
ala
…
```

This is by no means the optimal way of solving the problem - and could probably be made a lot more ‘pythonic’ - but it’s a good way of pretending to be better at the word puzzles than you actually are (which is good enough for me).
